# Configure Medusa Backend

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a file service in the Medusa backend and the methods you must implement in it.

The configurations for your Medusa backend are in `medusa-config.js` located in the root of your Medusa project. The configurations include database, modules, and plugin configurations, among other configurations.

`medusa-config.js` exports an object having the following properties:

- [projectConfig](page.mdx#projectconfig) (required): An object that holds general configurations related to the Medusa backend, such as database or CORS configurations.
- [admin](page.mdx#admin): An object that holds admin-related configurations.
- ConfigModule.plugins | plugins: An array of plugin configurations that defines what plugins are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [modules](page.mdx#modules): An object that defines what modules are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [featureFlags](page.mdx#featureflags): An object that enables or disables features guarded by a feature flag.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
  },
  admin: {
    // ...
  },
  modules: {
    // ...
  },
  featureFlags: {
    // ...
  }
})
```

## Environment Variables

It's highly recommended to store the values of configurations in environment variables, then reference them within `medusa-config.js`.

During development, you can set your environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of your Medusa backend project. In production,
setting the environment variables depends on the hosting provider.

---

## projectConfig

This property holds essential configurations related to the Medusa backend, such as database and CORS configurations.

### databaseName

The name of the database to connect to. If specified in `databaseUrl`, then it’s not required to include it.

Make sure to create the PostgreSQL database before using it. You can check how to create a database in
[PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html).

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseName: process.env.DATABASE_NAME ||
      "medusa-store",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseUrl

The connection URL of the database. The format of the connection URL for PostgreSQL is:

```bash
postgres://[user][:password]@[host][:port]/[dbname]
```

Where:

- `[user]`: (required) your PostgreSQL username. If not specified, the system's username is used by default. The database user that you use must have create privileges. If you're using the `postgres` superuser, then it should have these privileges by default. Otherwise, make sure to grant your user create privileges. You can learn how to do that in [PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html).
- `[:password]`: an optional password for the user. When provided, make sure to put `:` before the password.
- `[host]`: (required) your PostgreSQL host. When run locally, it should be `localhost`.
- `[:port]`: an optional port that the PostgreSQL server is listening on. By default, it's `5432`. When provided, make sure to put `:` before the port.
- `[dbname]`: (required) the name of the database.

You can learn more about the connection URL format in [PostgreSQL’s documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html).

#### Example

For example, set the following database URL in your environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/medusa-store
```

Then, use the value in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseSchema

The database schema to connect to. This is not required to provide if you’re using the default schema, which is `public`.

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseSchema: process.env.DATABASE_SCHEMA ||
      "custom",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseLogging

This configuration specifies what database messages to log. Its value can be one of the following:

- (default) A boolean value that indicates whether any messages should be logged.
- The string value `all` that indicates all types of messages should be logged.
- An array of log-level strings to indicate which type of messages to show in the logs. The strings can be `query`, `schema`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `log`, or `migration`. Refer to [Typeorm’s documentation](https://typeorm.io/logging#logging-options) for more details on what each of these values means.

If this configuration isn't set, its default value is `false`, meaning no database messages are logged.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseLogging: ["query", "error"]
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseDriverOptions

An object that includes additional configurations to pass to the database connection for v2. You can pass any configuration. One defined configuration to pass is
`ssl` which enables support for TLS/SSL connections.

This is useful for production databases, which can be supported by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` attribute of `ssl` object to `false`.
During development, it’s recommended not to pass this option.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseDriverOptions: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" ?
      { ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } } : {}
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

#### Properties

<TypeList types={[{"name":"connection","type":"`object`","description":"","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"ssl","type":"`object`","description":"Configure support for TLS/SSL connection","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"rejectUnauthorized","type":"`false`","description":"Whether to fail connection if the server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs and the hostname and no match is found.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}]}  sectionTitle="databaseDriverOptions"/>

### redisUrl

Used to specify the URL to connect to Redis. This is only used for scheduled jobs. If you omit this configuration, scheduled jobs won't work.

:::note

You must first have Redis installed. You can refer to [Redis's installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

:::

The Redis connection URL has the following format:

```bash
redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]
```

For a local Redis installation, the connection URL should be `redis://localhost:6379` unless you’ve made any changes to the Redis configuration during installation.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL ||
      "redis://localhost:6379",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### redisPrefix

The prefix set on all keys stored in Redis. The default value is `sess:`.

If this configuration option is provided, it is prepended to `sess:`.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisPrefix: process.env.REDIS_URL || "medusa:",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### redisOptions

An object of options to pass ioredis. You can refer to [ioredis’s RedisOptions documentation](https://redis.github.io/ioredis/index.html#RedisOptions)
for the list of available options.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisOptions: {
      connectionName: process.env.REDIS_CONNECTION_NAME ||
        "medusa",
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### sessionOptions

An object of options to pass to [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session).

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    sessionOptions: {
      name: process.env.SESSION_NAME || "custom",
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

#### Properties

<TypeList types={[{"name":"name","type":"`string`","description":"The name of the session ID cookie to set in the response (and read from in the request). The default value is `connect.sid`.\nRefer to [express-session’s documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session#name) for more details.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"resave","type":"`boolean`","description":"Whether the session should be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never modified during the request.

### jobsBatchSize

Configure the number of staged jobs that are polled from the database. Default is `1000`.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    jobsBatchSize: 100
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### workerMode

Configure the application's worker mode.

Workers are processes running separately from the main application. They're useful for executing long-running or resource-heavy tasks in the background, such as importing products.

With a worker, these tasks are offloaded to a separate process. So, they won't affect the performance of the main application.

![Diagram showcasing how the server and worker work together](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/fl\_lossy/f\_auto/r\_16/ar\_16:9,c\_pad/v1/Medusa%20Book/medusa-worker\_klkbch.jpg?\_a=BATFJtAA0)

Medusa has three runtime modes:

- Use `shared` to run the application in a single process.
- Use `worker` to run the a worker process only.
- Use `server` to run the application server only.

In production, it's recommended to deploy two instances:

1. One having the `workerMode` configuration set to `server`.
2. Another having the `workerMode` configuration set to `worker`.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    workerMode: process.env.WORKER_MODE || "shared"
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### http

Configure the application's http-specific settings

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      cookieSecret: "supersecret",
      compression: {
        // ...
      }
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

___

## admin

Admin dashboard configurations.

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    backendUrl: process.env.MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL ||
      "http://localhost:9000"
  },
  // ...
})
```

### disable

Whether to disable the admin dashboard. If set to `true`, the admin dashboard is disabled,
in both development and production environments. The default value is `false`.

### path

The path to the admin dashboard. The default value is `/app`.

The value cannot be one of the reserved paths:
- `/admin`
- `/store`
- `/auth`
- `/`

### outDir

The directory where the admin build is output. This is where the build process places the generated files.
The default value is `./build`.

### backendUrl

The URL of your Medusa backend. Defaults to an empty string, which means requests will hit the same server that serves the dashboard.

### vite

Configure the Vite configuration for the admin dashboard. This function receives the default Vite configuration
and returns the modified configuration. The default value is `undefined`.

___

## modules

In Medusa, commerce and core logic are modularized to allow developers to extend or replace certain [modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/modules/overview)
with custom implementations.

Aside from installing the module with NPM, you must add it to the exported object in `medusa-config.js`.

The keys of the `modules` configuration object refer to the module's registration name. Its value can be one of the following:

1. A boolean value indicating whether the module type is enabled. This is only supported for Medusa's commerce and architectural modules;
2. Or an object having the following properties:
    1. `resolve`: a string indicating the path to the module relative to `src`, or the module's NPM package name.
    2. `options`: (optional) an object indicating the options to pass to the module.
    3. `definition`: (optional) an object of extra configurations, such as `isQueryable` used when a module has relationships.

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  modules: {
    helloModuleService: {
      resolve: "./modules/hello"
    }
  }
  // ...
})
```

___

## featureFlags

Some features in the Medusa backend are guarded by a feature flag. This ensures constant shipping of new features while maintaining the engine’s stability.

You can specify whether a feature should or shouldn’t be used in your backend by enabling its feature flag. Feature flags can be enabled through either environment
variables or through this configuration exported in `medusa-config.js`.

The `featureFlags` configuration is an object. Its properties are the names of the feature flags. Each property’s value is a boolean indicating whether the feature flag is enabled.

You can find available feature flags and their key name [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/packages/medusa/src/loaders/feature-flags).

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  featureFlags: {
    product_categories: true,
    // ...
  }
  // ...
})
```

:::note

After enabling a feature flag, make sure to run migrations as it may require making changes to the database.
